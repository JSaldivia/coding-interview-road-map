# Welcome to my coding-interview-road-map!

## I'm JosÃ© 
## My main goal for this repository is to serve as a log of my progress throughout my job search journey. Feel free to explore my updates and reflections as I navigate through this process.



## From planning to execution.

## Not all the roadmaps will take you to your goals but they will for sure take you to where you belong 

### I recently discovered [John Washam's](https://github.com/jwasham) repository, which offers insightful resources for preparing for [job interviews](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). It's definitely worth exploring!

For this documment, I will be also using his recommended [git basic grammar](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) among other tools such as the following: 
- [x] [ROADMAP](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science)  
- [x] [CODING](https://programiz.pro/)
- [x] [BOOKS] 
    - [ ] C Programming Language, 2nd Edition 2nd Edition

> [!TIP]
> Advice for doing things better and more easily.
> When scanning for Increment INCR do a nested if:

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ]
- [ ]  
> Another way to implement the INCR is to modify the ADD token

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information the user/s need to know about this program.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate attention to avoid problems.
> While implementing any token remember how if statement and logical conditions work!!! 

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
> Therefore if a condition is meet, before time it would be a bug in the code
> Example:
> - [ ] IF implementing add first
> - [ ] Increment will never run!!!
> Then is important to either keep INCR in its own if statement before ADD or modify the ADD token!
