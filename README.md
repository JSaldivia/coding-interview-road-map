> [!TIP]
> Advice for doing things better and more easily.
> When scanning for Increment INCR do a nested if:

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ]
- [ ]  
> Another way to implement the INCR is to modify the ADD token

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information the user/s need to know about this program.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate attention to avoid problems.
> While implementing any token remember how if statement and logical conditions work!!! 

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
> Therefore if a condition is meet, before time it would be a bug in the code
> Example:
> - [ ] IF implementing add first
> - [ ] Increment will never run!!!
> Then is important to either keep INCR in its own if statement before ADD or modify the ADD token!
