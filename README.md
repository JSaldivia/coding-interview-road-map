# Welcome! 

## Not all the roadmaps will take you to your goals but they will for sure take you to where you belong!!!

### Hi, I am JosÃ© Saldivia:
I want to share my journey with all of you by making this repositori public. While I am learning and preparing for interviews, this log will also work to documment my progress.\ 
My focus will be in Software Engineering using C, a low level language I have pick in order to challange my problem solving skills by thinking outside of the box while understanding more about memory allocation, and memory leacks.\
Before starting, I will advice you to check some cool gides or do some readings regarding programming languages and which one will fit you best.\
While choosing a language, is recommended to ask yourself what are your goal? do you to explore the realm of web dev, software, data science, mobile, cross platform? This are some questins to help sort out while picking a programming language.\
But keep in mind there is no right nor wrong when choosing a language, just pick one and make the best learning experience. Have fun, print [Hello, World!]() breake your working code, break it again and read what the compiler says! 
Repeat this step as many times as possible to get comfortable with error messages and warnings.

### In addition I want to add a recently discovery:  
[John Washam's](https://github.com/jwasham) repository!!! this offers insightful resources for preparing for [job interviews](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). and its definitely worth exploring!

> [!NOTE] 
> Reminder!!! This repository is a log of my progress throughout my job hunts journey, a guided doccument while preparing for coding interviews.

I will be going trough:

> [!NOTE]
- Leetcode, and neetcode are important sources to keep in mind
for the past few months I slacked on the work on it and focused on my internship
but after being reach out by Google, Amazon and Meta I realize the importance on 
Practice practice and practice! 
in case I did not mentioned... Practice even more! 
that is how you get good at DSA, there are no shortcuts just work. 



## From planning to execution.


- [x] [Hello GIT!](#Welcome!)
Before anything happens I recommend a short reading on: [Choosing a programming language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-for-a-project/).\
For me, I will be focusing on C, with the main goal of preparing for interviews either in C or Python (most popular for interviews)
The reasons? I want to have a solid knowladge on a low level language, handle memory leaks, and get more comfortable with a low level language while learning DSA.\
I believe this will help me to learn other languages and frameworks faster.\

> [!NOTE] 
> The basics for programming languages are the same!, the differences relays not in the libraries or syntax, but mainly in the
> problem solving skills we develop as programmers.

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know!!!
> DSA on leet code is giving me examples on Java, therefore I will be swapping between Java and C to be more on the loop
> An addition to it, practicing more about Arrays and understand them will be helpfull for the future on DSA
> [!TIP]
> Advice for doing things better and more easily.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information the user/s need to know about this program.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
