# Welcome! 

I'm Jos√© Saldivia
This repository will serve as a log of my progress throughout my job search journey. I will be focus on Software engineering mostly, but if the direction changes I will address it in a new repo. 
The log will also doccument my progress in subjects such as 
- [] Introduction to programming
    - [] Starting Point (from zero to arrays and linked lists)
- [] DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms)
    - [] Linked lists and Arrays
    - [] Queue
    - [] Stacks
    - [] Hash Tables
    - [] Trees
        - [] What are Trees?
        - [] Binary Search Trees
        - [] DFS (Depth-First Search)
        - [] BFS (Breadth-First Search)
        - [] Balanced Searc trees
        - [] Tree traversals: pre/post/in-order DFS, BFS
    - [] Sorting
        -[] Insertions sort
        -[] Selection sort
        -[] Heap sort
        -[] Merge sort
    - [] Graphs
        - [] what are graphs?
        - [] Directed and Undirected
        - [] Adjacency List
        - [] Adjacency Matrix
        - [] 
- [] Algrothm Comlexity (Big-O notation)

 Feel free to explore my updates and reflections as I navigate through this process.


## From planning to execution.


- [x] [Hello GIT!](#Welcome!)
Before anything happens we need to choose our programming language:
For me, I will be focusing on C, with the main goal of transitioning to C++
The reasons? I want to have a solid knowladge on memory allocation and I believe it will help me to learn other languages and frameworks faster.
NOTE: The basics are the same in any language, the difference are libraries and syntax. But the problem solving skills are unique to each programmer.

## Not all the roadmaps will take you to your goals but they will for sure take you to where you belong 

### I recently discovered [John Washam's](https://github.com/jwasham) repository, which offers insightful resources for preparing for [job interviews](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). It's definitely worth exploring!

For this documment, I will be also using his recommended [git basic grammar](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) among other tools such as the following: 
- [x] [ROADMAP](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science)  
- [x] [CODING](https://programiz.pro/)
- [x] [BOOKS] 
    - [ ] C Programming Language, 2nd Edition 2nd Edition  
    - [ ] CRACKING the CODING INTERVIEW

> [!TIP]
> Advice for doing things better and more easily.
> When scanning for Increment INCR do a nested if:

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ]
- [ ]  
> Another way to implement the INCR is to modify the ADD token

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information the user/s need to know about this program.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate attention to avoid problems.
> While implementing any token remember how if statement and logical conditions work!!! 

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
> Therefore if a condition is meet, before time it would be a bug in the code
> Example:
> - [ ] IF implementing add first
> - [ ] Increment will never run!!!
> Then is important to either keep INCR in its own if statement before ADD or modify the ADD token!
