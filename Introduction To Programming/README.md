# Introduction to programming
This part of the program has been completed following steps:
- [X] ***Choosing a programming language***
    - [x] Readings from internet on how to choose a programming language and the importance each one
    - [x] Learning the basic concepts on that language (in my case I have choose C)
    - [ ] Understand the basics and practice // In Progress ☠️
