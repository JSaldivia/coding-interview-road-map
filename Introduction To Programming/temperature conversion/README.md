## Hello Git ðŸ‘»

# The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it!!!

In this code we are using variables, different data types 
and loops. 
this kind of information will be review later as I am following now the book:
### The C Programming Language Second edition
For the introduction to programming I will be focusing mainly in two parts.

The 4hs video from [bro code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A&t=1475s&ab_channel=BroCode)
and the book [The C Programming Language Second edition](https://a.co/d/d8JclhX)

As I advance in both I will be doing some examples and excercices from the book.

Happy learning and don't forget to break your code!
